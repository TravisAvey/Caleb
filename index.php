		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<div class="container">
			<p>
				Few artists have that special essence that immediately attracts people to them, and even fewer artists maintain their musical roots through and through to the core.  
				Caleb Westbrook is undoubtedly one of the few.  In fact, he is a rarity!  Born and raised in a God-fearing, southern family in Corpus Christi, Caleb has undoubtedly maintained his deep southern roots, from his cowboy boots to his sweet, country twang.  
				He accredits most of his musical talents to God and to his upbringing.  He picked up his first guitar at age 11, and, after two short months, he became the lead rhythm guitarist for his father’s Praise and Worship band.  
				During years of practice and honing in on his craft, Caleb’s love for music expanded and branched out to a wide variety of musical genres; however, his love for country remains at the forefront.  
				As Caleb says, “I have a particular love for country music, because I’m a country boy from a country family.”  Believe me… you can’t take the south out of this good ole’ southern boy!
			</p>

			<p>
				Caleb is currently a local resident of Nashville, TN where he continues to 

				sit in and play with several local bands in the downtown area, and he continues to 

				collaborate with other artists in the Nashville scene to create music to share at local

				writer’s nights.

				Caleb Westbrook is Nashville’s hidden diamond, and the time is coming when

				his musical gifts will be discovered by more than his already largely growing fan 

				base. When that time comes, and when his musical light will finally be unleashed, 

				there will not be ANY stopping him! With his wholesome southern charm and his 

				country-to-the-core lifestyle, Caleb Westbrook is the real deal!
